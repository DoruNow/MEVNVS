# MEVNVS
MEVN stack plus Vuetify and Socket implementation in a TS implementation

I kept this repo as skeletal as possible so it can be easily forked.

There is no mongo implementation here since there are multiple paths to set up a mongo db, and they are not scary at all.

When this repo was created, vuetify and socket.io did not play nice with typescript straight out of the box.

### In the client folder:

```
npm i && npm run serve
```

### In the server folder:

```
npm i && npm run dev
```

The button stylings come from vuetify so you know it works.
